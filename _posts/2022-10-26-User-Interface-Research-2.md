#### Title of The Game

Title is the most important thing in the game. Because even though the game is really fun, if the title is not attractive, no one will play the game.

Our team discussed about the title of the game. We decided the title as "Mondriann's Calculator". There are reasons why we chosed this name:

1. Since the game screen shows similar color to the famous artist Mondriann's painting, and
2. The game is mostly about calculation.

#### Sound Effect

Most of the information users receive when playing mobile games is visual and auditory.

We decided to make the program make a sound when:

1. The user touches the block
    - Make a small sound
2. Make a different type of sounds when the answer either is right or wrong.
3. The user completes the round, make a funny sound such as "Kachow"

#### Game Difficulty Control

This part was the most time consuming part

1. Multiple numbers in one block
2. Adjust the size and the number of the 'numbers' in the block
3. Adjust the length of the equation

At final, we decided to choose option *2*
