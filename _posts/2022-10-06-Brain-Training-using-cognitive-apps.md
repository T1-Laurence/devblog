## TL;DR (Too Long Didn't Read)

---

Users who trained with the games improved regardless of age in terms of scores and processing speed throughout the 100 sessions, suggesting that old and very old adults can improve their cognitive performance using CMG in real-life use.

## Introduction

---

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO. Ageing and Health (WHO, 2018)`

Dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key strategy to mitigate the identifed risk factors

In cognitively healthy people aged 65 or older, there was some evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of computerized cognitive training may improve cognition

Processing speed training resulted in reduced dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 (95% CI 0.50–0.99), p=0.049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training generated no signifcant risk reduction (HR 0.79 (0.57–1.11), p=0.18 and HR0.79 (0.56–1.10), p=0.16, respectively)

Previous studies have suggested a benefcial efect of structured cognitive training using commercially available applications in healthy older adults

## Results

---

Statistically signifcant differences were observed for the diferent CMG (p<0.001) and within the CMG for the diferent age groups for Memory Sweep (p=0.013), Babble Bots (p<0.001) and Unique (p<0.001).

## CMG scores

---

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants

## Processing speed

---

For Word Pairs we observed an decrease in the processing speed in all age groups. For Square Numbers, Unique and Rush Back there was a statistically signifcant increase for all participant age groups, however as for the score, the increase of the processing speed is more marked for younger participants. For Must Sort, only participants aged 70 and over presented a decrease in processing speed while the other age groups presented a slight increase, but in both cases the magnitude was relatively small

## Discussion

---

we showed that CMG scores are correlated with the cognitive abilities of older adults with and without cognitive impairments
