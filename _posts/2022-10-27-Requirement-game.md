#### Requirements of The Game

As our team finished discussing how to make the game, we need to organize the requirements for the game.

This is how I concluded the basic requirements for the game.

Making a requirement is important because the developer could misunderstood the concepts and does not produce a program that the customer wants.

By making a requirement, the customer can make the points clear, and the game developer can understand what the customer wants.
