### UI Design Ideas for Mobile Puzzle Game

The Process of driving and ending games in the app is largely divided into five parts.

1. Puzzle Game Type Selection
2. Tutorial(If the user is first to the selected type of puzzle game)
3. Puzzle Game(The user will operate the puzzle game).
4. End Screen
    - The screen will show the game score, compared with other users.
    - It will also show 3 options
        - 'Play it again'
        - 'Home'
        - 'Other Puzzle'
5. If the user select 'Home', the screen will show the main home of the app

### Other Ideas
